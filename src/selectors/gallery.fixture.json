It’s no wonder he left Earth to discover who he was meant to be.\n\nThe Envisioner was born with a gift, one that would take him decades to discover how to harness. But once he did, he led a movement behind one of his visions — a world where everyone strives to unleash their potential.\n\nAfter years in the trenches leading teams of special forces on secretive missions, The Envisioner settled on the planet Cayterra, a place he had come to love for its modern architecture and connection with the planet’s natural raw beauty.\n\nHe now leads X-Team, the protectors of the universe, helping to keep peace and protect the freedom of all beings to unleash and bring about good in the world.\n"
